Follow SOLID.
Prefer NestJS best practices.
Do not generate new abstractions unless requested.
Be concise.
Follow test driven development.
Task is not done if it's not tested.
If you need to know something like architecture, etc, then go to 'mds' folder, it's in the root folder and go the file you think you need to go in, it will give you clarity about the project.
